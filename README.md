# List Manipulation Functions in Dart
This repository contains sample code demonstrating how to manipulate lists in Dart. 

## Introduction
All code examples are available in the `main.dart` file.

All code has been tested on Dart 2.19.2

Run code using the following command:
```dart main.dart```

## Table of Contents
The following functions are covered:

- `add`: adds an element to the end of a list
- `insert`: inserts an element at a specific index in a list
- `addAll`: adds multiple elements to the end of a list
- `remove`: removes the first occurrence of an element from a list
- `removeAt`: removes an element at a specific index in a list
- `removeLast`: removes the last element from a list
- `removeRange`: removes a range of elements from a list
- `clear`: removes all elements from a list
- `shuffle`: Randomly shuffles the elements in the list.
- `sublist`: Returns a new list containing a specified range of elements from an existing list.
- `sort`: Sorts the elements in the list.
- `map`: Applies a function to each element in the list and returns a new list with the results. 
- `firstWhere`: Returns the first element that satisfies a specified condition.
- `where`: Returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy a specified condition.
- `forEach`: Executes a function for each element in the list.
- `fold`: Accumulates a single value by applying a function to each element in the list.
- `reduce`: Reduces the list to a single value by applying a function to each element.
- `any`: Checks if at least one element in the list satisfies a specified condition.
- `every`: Checks if all elements in the list satisfy a specified condition.
- `expand`: Expand keyword applies a function to each element in the list and returns a new list with the results.

This repository contains sample code demonstrating various list manipulation functions in Dart. 
Below is a list of the functions covered, along with a brief explanation of what each function does and a code example.

## Functions

1. `add()`
The add function adds an element to the end of a list.

```dart
  List<int> oddNumbers = [1, 3, 5];
  oddNumbers.add(7);
  print(oddNumbers); // [1, 3, 5, 7]
```
